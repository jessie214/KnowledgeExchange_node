# KnowledgeExchange API

## Introduction

The KnowledgeExchange API is a Node.js project designed to provide backend services for a knowledge exchange platform. It offers a RESTful API for user authentication, question posting, answer posting, voting, and other functionalities similar to popular Q&A platforms.

## Features

- User Authentication: Register, login, logout, and authentication using JWT tokens.
- Question Management: CRUD operations for questions, including posting, editing, and deleting questions.
- Answer Management: CRUD operations for answers, including posting, editing, and deleting answers.
- Voting System: Allow users to upvote or downvote questions and answers.
- Search: Search for questions or answers based on keywords or tags.

## Installation

To run the project locally, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository: `git clone https://github.com/yourusername/knowledge-exchange-api.git`
2. Navigate to the project directory: `cd knowledge-exchange-api`
3. Install dependencies: `npm install`
4. Configure environment variables: Create a `.env` file based on the provided `.env.example` file and configure the required variables.

## Usage

Once the server is running, you can send HTTP requests to the API endpoints to perform various actions. Below are some examples:

- Register a new user: `POST /api/auth/register`
- Login: `POST /api/auth/login`
- Post a new question: `POST /api/questions`
- Post a new answer: `POST /api/questions/:questionId/answers`
- Upvote a question: `PUT /api/questions/:questionId/upvote`
- Downvote an answer: `PUT /api/questions/:questionId/answers/:answerId/downvote`
